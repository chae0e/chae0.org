        <p>
            In collaboration with Juyoung Lee. Landscapes of proverbs is a curriculum consisting of three small classes
            that explore old Korean proverbs and invite to be part of the collective drawing.</p>
        <p>In the first session, students are invited to randomly pick three proverbs (printed on the paper) from a box
            and read them together. After guessing what they mean, searching for unfamiliar words in a Korean
            dictionary, and understanding the meaning, each student picks one proverb they wish to work on. Cutting the
            sentence into smaller words and then each word becomes one illustration.</p>
        <p>In the second session, students are invited to either continue creating the illustrations or refine the ones
            they already made.
        </p>
        <p>In the last session, students are asked to pick five illustrations made by fellow students. After selecting
            illustration cards, they create one traditional-Korean-style landscape drawing by copying them and adding
            new ones.</p>
        <p>The intention was to create dynamics between different age groups and classmates by mixing, choosing, and
            copying different styles of drawings.</p>
